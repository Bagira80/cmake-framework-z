# luchs - lazy uniform CMake helper scripts

> Luchs [l äks] is German for lynx, which is a species of the wild cat genus of the same name.

A general framework for using modern CMake uniformly with larger (C/C++) software projects that
reduces boiler-blate but still allows flexibility.

### Purpose

This CMake framework should provide some useful base for implementing larger C++ software projects
which use CMake as its build-system (generator). It allows simple (aka lazy) and uniform creation
of a CMake based build-system.

### History

This CMake framework originated during my time at my former employer [BENOCS](https://www.benocs.com)
between 2019 and 2021.  
During its implementation I encountered several problems with CMake itself, which I mostly fixed
upstream in CMake's code itself.

### Acknowledgements

Thanks to BENOCS and in particular to its CTO Ingmar Poese for the permission and encouragement to
open-source this software framework.
