## Purpose

This is a collection of CMake scripts that together make up a convenient CMake support framework
which should simplify and generalize using CMake.

It should be used by larger CMake based projects to conveniently and uniformly build them.

## Origin

The foundation of the _luchs_ CMake support framework was originally developed by
[Deniz Bahadir](mailto:deniz@code.bahadir.email) at his former employer
[BENOCS](https://www.benocs.com) and open-sourced under the
[Boost Software License](https://www.boost.org/LICENSE_1_0.txt).

This original code can be found at [Github](https://github.com/DenizThatMenace/luchs/tree/v0.1.0-benocs).

Further development took place during Deniz' time at his new employer
[exocad](https://www.exocad.com), who kindly agreed to also make those
advancements available as open-source.
